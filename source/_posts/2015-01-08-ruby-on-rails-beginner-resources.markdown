<p>
Are you trying to learn Ruby on Rails? The good news is that there are an enormous amount of beginner resources out there to help you learn. The bad news is that you can’t possibly go through them all so you will have to ignore most and settle on a few of them.
</p>
<p>
I’ve spent the last seven months learning Ruby and Ruby On Rails. Over the course of that time I have gone through many learning resources including books, online videos, subscription services, web tutorials, and more. Some of these were great and some barely helped me at all. 
<p>
Here are some of my favorites and why I loved them. (Hopefully you will too!)

<h3>
<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl (web tutorial)
</h3>
<p>
This is a must if you are just beginning or you only have time for one thing. Michael Hartl’s tutorial is the best tutorial(free or not) i’ve ever gone through. You will learn a little bit of many things and at the end will have a fully working twitter style app. It is a really comprehensive tutorial to get you going. He recently updated the whole tutorial so the content is very up to date. Be warned that it will take a while to get through. Take it slow and you will learn a lot.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a> (book)
</h3>
<p>
At some point you will hit a wall trying to learn Rails if you don’t make an attempt at learning the fundamentals of its underlying language. This is a great introduction to Ruby and one of the best programming books i’ve ever read. It’s a little fast paced so you might want to look elsewhere if are coming to Rails with no prior programming experience at all. After finishing give The Eloquent Rubyist a look.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="https://upcase.com/">Upcase</a> (subscription service)
</h3>
<p>
This is a monthly subscription service that currently costs $30/m. I’m generally skeptical of subscription services because they don’t always have enough material to warrant the costs. I make an exception for Upcase because there is a good amount of content for the money. They have many tutorial videos, exercises, private forums, and more. It’s definitely worth trying for a month to see if you like it.

<h3>
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x#.VK1oE2RdUQ4
">Software as a Service</a> (edX MOOC)
</h3>
<p> 
Massively Open Online Courses(MOOCs) are a very popular choice for learning. I have taken a few that covered Rails/Ruby and this was the best. I will warn that the course can be a little fast paced and all over the place at times. One minute they are discussing an introductory topic and the next minute you’ll be confused by some unrelated advanced topic. Push through it and you learn a lot. They cover many topics in the course related to Rails and writing web apps in general.

<h3>
<a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">Roby Rogues</a> (podcast)
</h3>
<p> 
I love programming podcasts. I listen to several of them. This one is great not just because it’s about Ruby but because the hosts do a great job of discussing topics in a way that new programmers can understand. If you have time for a second, check out thoughtbot’s excellent Robots podcast.

I hope my suggestions will help you get going! Don’t forget <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> when you get stuck on something and if you are looking for a more guided approach to learning I would suggest looking into <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.
