In the past couple of weeks I have been obsessed with a website called
[exercism.io](http://exercism.io/). It is a website for working on programming problems in
different languages. The interesting aspect to it is that once you get
your code working, you upload it to the website and other people will
review and comment on your code.

I find that this feedback really helps improve my code. I love going
through other people’s solutions to see what I could have done
differently and often I find that my solution could be improved a lot.
The website has another feature where you can keep updating your code
and then upload new versions of your solution. If you are beginning with
a language or simply want to practice your skills I can’t recommend this
enough.
