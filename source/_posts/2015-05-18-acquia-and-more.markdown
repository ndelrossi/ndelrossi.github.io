The job search is over. I'm going to be starting at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) on June 1st
as part of their [AcquiaU program](http://u.acquia.com/). I'm very excited as this is exactly the kind of
opportunity I was looking for.

Acquia uses a number of technologies that I have little or no
experience with so I'll be shifting focus of my side projects to
include these technologies. I have begun re-learning php from scratch, have started a [Drupal 8
Developer blog](http://nickdelrossiea7jrjozwo.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/), and have been fooling around with a php web framework
called Symfony. More to come soon.
