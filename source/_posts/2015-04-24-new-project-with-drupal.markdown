Recently I started experimenting with Drupal which is a content
management platform. I had not realized before that it is an open source
project or I probably would have checked it out sooner. I have created a
[Drupal development blog](http://timeoffn57xwjiemu.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/)
for everything I am learning and of course I am using Drupal for that.

So far I am loving the experience. A friend works at a company called Acquia
and I was really curious about their
products so I am trying their Dev Desktop client and their cloud service
to host the website. I was surprised how easy it was to get started.
