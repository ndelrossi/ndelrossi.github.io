I am obsessed with podcasts. In the spring of 2014 I began to devote a lot of time to learning web development and one of the first things I did was search for podcasts on the subject. I'm compiling a short list here of my favorite episodes that really helped me get going in web development.

Most of these are soft topics. They cover the process of learning, what skills to learn, how to overcome beginning barriers, and more. If you are trying to enter the field from a non-standard path I especially recommend these.

While I've tried many podcasts, there are definitely great episodes from shows I've never tried or never heard about. If you know of one that helped you I'd love to hear about it.

These are my picks:

[This Developer's Life: Episode 2.0.8 - Learn](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/2-0-8-learn)<br>
I'm just going to paste the website's own description because I think it sums it up well: "How many empty brain cells do you have in your head? How capable are you of learning something completely new, and retaining what you already know? Scott and Rob talk to two developers this week who flex their ability to learn to both have fun, and succeed at their career."

[Javascript Jabber: Episode 118 - Web Developer Skills](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/118-jsj-web-developer-skills)<br>
This is a discussion about the skills a web developer needs to have to compete in today's market. If you are unsure about what learning path to go down as a new web developer then this is a must listen.

[Ruby Rogues: Episode 131 - How to Learn](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/131-rr-how-to-learn)<br>
This episode is all about how to become better at things, how to practice, and how to develop skill. The podcast is centered around the programming language Ruby but the message here is universal and will apply to other languages.

[The Hanselminutes Podcast: Episode 442 - Being a CodeNewbie with Saron Yitbarek](http://hanselminutes.com/442/being-a-codenewbie-with-saron-yitbarek)<br>
A discussion with guest Saron Yitbarek about being new to programming. I've heard Saron speak in a number of places about her non-standard path to becoming a programmer. Her story is inspiring. If you are trying to get into the field without a CS degree or if you think your background prevents you from entering this field, I highly recommend this.

[The Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots: Episode 114 - Offer Value First](http://giantrobots.fm/114)<br>
The message from this discussion comes from a quote by venture investor Chris Sacca: "Create value before you ask for value back". This is probably great advice for any career but they go into specifics here about how this can help you get a job in development.

[Ruby Rogues: Episode 187 - Marketing Yourself as a Software Developer with John Sonmez](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/187-marketing-yourself-as-a-software-developer-with-john-sonmez)<br>
The title of this podcast says it all. This discussion is all about the things you can do outside of actual programming to improve your career and get the job you want.
