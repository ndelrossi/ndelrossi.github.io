I have been working hard over the last month or so on a new project called Commitwith. An early, very much in-progress version is up at [www.commitwith.com](http://www.commitwith.com). It is intended to be a web app where users can view and list open-source projects.

I got the idea last year learning Ruby On Rails. I was always interested in working on open-source projects but all the ones people recommended were these mammoth projects with 100,000+ lines of code and hundreds of contributors. I wanted to find smaller projects where the owner and contributors were of similar skill to my own. I know they are out there but I couldn’t find them anywhere.

I started creating the web app with the idea that it would be a place for beginner’s to list and find projects but I have expanded the scope to include developers of all levels. I am trying to build a robust search and filter system that allows anyone to find the right project for them.

The website is live for testing. Add your project or search for one and let me know what you think. Please keep in mind that it is still in the early stages so I may be deleting the database or making drastic changes from time to time.
