I am obsessed with podcasts. In the spring of 2014 I began to devote a lot of time to learning web development and one of the first things I did was search for podcasts on the subject. I'm compiling a short list here of my favorite episodes that really helped me get going in web development.

Most of these are soft topics. They cover the process of learning, what skills to learn, how to overcome beginning barriers, and more. Often the problem with learning something new is not the subject itself but how to approach it and how to overcome the initial barriers to entry.

While I've tried many podcasts, there are definitely great episodes from shows I've never tried or never heard about. If you know of one that helped you I'd love to hear about them.

These are my picks:

[This Developer's Life: Episode 2.0.8 - Learn](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/2-0-8-learn)<br>
I'm just going to paste the website's own description because I think it sums it up well: "How many empty brain cells do you have in your head? How capable are you of learning something completely new, and retaining what you already know? Scott and Rob talk to two developers this week who flex their ability to learn to both have fun, and succeed at their career."

[Javascript Jabber: Episode 118 - Web Developer Skills](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/118-jsj-web-developer-skills)<br>
This is a discussion about the skills a web developer needs to have to compete in today's market. If you are unsure about what learning path to go down as a new web developer then this is a must listen.
